üõ°Ô∏è Splunk DNS Log Analysis

This module demonstrates how DNS logs can be ingested, analyzed, and visualized in Splunk as part of the NIDS-Suricata lab. The workflow includes **log ingestion, field extraction, enrichment, SPL commands, and visualization**.



1Ô∏è‚É£ Log Ingestion
Import DNS log files into Splunk using a defined `sourcetype`.





2Ô∏è‚É£ Field Extraction
Parse raw DNS logs into meaningful fields such as `src_ip`, `dest_ip`, `dns_query`, `qtype`, `rcode_name`, and `proto`.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Using eval
Create new fields or categorize DNS queries using `eval` commands.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Using transaction
Group related DNS query-response events into single logical events using `transaction`.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Using table / stats count
Summarize queries by client IP, domain, or response code using `table` and `stats count` commands.

‚úÖ Summary
This workflow complements Suricata NIDS alerts by providing contextual visibility into DNS traffic, helping identify potential reconnaissance, suspicious queries, or misconfigurations in the network.
