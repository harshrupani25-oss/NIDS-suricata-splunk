This module demonstrates how DNS logs can be ingested, analyzed, and visualized in Splunk as part of the NIDS-Suricata lab. The analysis includes:

Log Ingestion: Importing DNS log files into Splunk using a defined sourcetype.

Field Extraction: Parsing raw DNS logs into meaningful fields such as src_ip, dest_ip, dns_query, qtype, rcode_name, and proto.




Data Enrichment: (Optional) Using lookups or external CSVs to enrich IP addresses with asset names or locations.

Search and Analysis: Utilizing SPL commands to gain insights:

eval → Create new fields and categorize DNS queries.

transaction → Group related DNS query-response events.

table / stats count → Summarize queries by client IP, domain, or response code.

Visualization: Generating tables, charts, and summary statistics to detect abnormal DNS activity.

This workflow complements Suricata NIDS alerts by providing contextual visibility into DNS traffic, helping identify potential reconnaissance, suspicious queries, or misconfigurations in the network.
