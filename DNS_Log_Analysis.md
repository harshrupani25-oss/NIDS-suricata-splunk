DNS Log Analysis Overview

This DNS log analysis demonstrates how DNS traffic can be ingested, parsed, and analyzed in Splunk as part of the NIDS-Suricata lab. The analysis includes:

- Log Ingestion:Importing DNS logs into Splunk with a defined sourcetype.
- Field Extraction:Parsing raw DNS logs into meaningful fields such as:
  - `src_ip` ‚Äì Source IP of the query
  - `dest_ip` ‚Äì Destination IP (DNS server)
  - `dns_query` ‚Äì Queried domain name
  - `qtype` ‚Äì Query type (e.g., A, PTR)
  - `rcode_name` ‚Äì Response code (e.g., NXDOMAIN)
  - `proto` ‚Äì Protocol (UDP/TCP)
- SPL Commands Used:
  - `eval` ‚Üí Create new fields or categorize queries
  - `transaction` ‚Üí Group related query-response events
  - `table / stats count` ‚Üí Summarize queries by IP, domain, or response
- Data Enrichment (Optional):Using CSV lookup files to add context like location or client name.
- dedup removes duplicate events based on specified fields, keeping only the first occurrence of each unique value.
- Screenshots:Six screenshots demonstrating field extraction, SPL queries, and dashboards.


üõ°Ô∏è Splunk DNS Log Analysis

This module demonstrates how DNS logs can be ingested, analyzed, and visualized in Splunk as part of the NIDS-Suricata lab. The workflow includes **log ingestion, field extraction, enrichment, SPL commands, and visualization**.

---

1. Log Ingestion
Import DNS log files into Splunk using a defined `sourcetype`.

---

2Ô∏è. Field Extraction
Parse raw DNS logs into meaningful fields such as `src_ip`, `src_port`, `dst_ip`, `dst_port`, `dns_query`, `fqdn`, `rcode_type`, and `protocol`.

---

3Ô∏è. Data Enrichment
(Optional) Enrich IP addresses or other fields using lookups or external CSVs.

---

4Ô∏è. Using eval
Create new fields or categorize DNS queries using `eval` commands.

---

5Ô∏è. Using transaction 
Group related DNS query-response events into single logical events using `transaction`.

Using transaction / table:-

---

6Ô∏è. Using stats count
Summarize queries by client IP, domain, or response code using `table` and `stats count` commands.

---

7. dedup removes duplicate events based on specified fields, keeping only the first occurrence of each unique value.

‚úÖ Summary
This workflow complements Suricata NIDS alerts by providing **contextual visibility into DNS traffic**, helping identify potential reconnaissance, suspicious queries, or misconfigurations in the network.
